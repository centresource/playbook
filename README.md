# Playbook for Rails

This project serves as a starting point for Centresource's frontend
assets. This project's structure is highly influenced from the generated
asset folders from
[generator-playbook](https://github.com/centresource/generator-playbook).

## Assumptions

This project assumes you're using
[Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails),
[Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) and
[Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat).

If you're using a different platform, you'll want to change the
references to Bourbon and Neat in
[screen.scss](https://github.com/centresource/playbook/blob/master/styles/screen.scss).
